  speakers:
    - name: Robert C. Hockett
      description: |
        Robert Hockett joined the Cornell Law Faculty in 2004. His principal teaching, research, 
        and writing interests lie in the fields of organizational, financial, and monetary law 
        and economics in both their positive and normative, as well as their national and 
        transnational, dimensions. His guiding concern in these fields is with the legal and 
        institutional prerequisites to a just, prosperous, and sustainable economic order.
        <br /><br />
        A Fellow of the Century Foundation and regular commissioned author for the New America 
        Foundation, Hockett also does regular consulting work for the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
        York, the International Monetary Fund, Americans for Financial Reform, the 'Occupy' 
        Cooperative, and a number of federal and state legislators and local governments.

        Monetary Fund and clerked for the Honorable Deanell Reece Tacha, Chief Judge of the U.S. 
        Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

    - name: Ehud Shapiro
      description: |
        Ehud Shapiro is an interdisciplinary scientist, entrepreneur, artist, and political activist. He 
        earned his BA/BSc in mathematics and philosophy from Tel Aviv University in 1979 and his PhD in 
        computer science from Yale in 1982; he has been with the Weizmann Institute of Science since then, 
        where he holds the Harry Weinrebe Professorial Chair of Computer Science and Biology. His PhD 
        research on inductive logic programming and algorithmic debugging has served as a foundation for 
        these two disciplines. At Weizmann, he developed the discipline of concurrent logic programming and 
        the distributed logic programming language Concurrent Prolog, in collaboration with the Japanese 
        Fifth Generation Computer Systems project. In 1993, he founded Ubique Ltd., the first internet social 
        networking software start-up. In 1995, Ubique launched Virtual Places 1.0, a social networking/2D 
        metaverse application with 2D avatars on web pages, providing instant messaging, chat rooms, joint and 
        guided web surfing, online events and games, and integrated voice-over IP. This was well before 
        Facebook was founded and two and a half decades before it announced its interest in the metaverse. 
        He sold Ubique to America Online, performed a management buyout, and then sold it again in 1998 to 
        IBM, where its technology was the basis of Sametime, IBM's successful corporate network communication 
        and collaboration product. 
        <br /><br />
        Upon return to Weizmann in 1998, Ehud switched to biology, and led research projects on biomolecular 
        computers, synthetic biology, and human cell lineage reconstruction, for which he received two ERC 
        Advanced Grants. In 2017, he began working on digital democracy, initially with Nimrod Talmon and later 
        also with collaborators and a research team he formed at Weizmann. In 2020, Ehud founded a new 
        Israeli political party, democratit. Ehud is a bass singer and the founder and artistic director of the 
        Ba Rock Band. He is presently on sabbatical at Columbia University in its computer science department.
    - name: Michael Warner
      description: |
        Mike Warner is a technology strategist who works in the Federal Reserve (FRS) of San Francisco. He is 
        focused on the intersection of emerging digital/social systems of value (payments), intelligence 
        (economics) and trust (supervision) as they relate to inflective innovations and the landscape for a 
        new digitally enabled economy. Over his nine years at the Fed, he has worked with the TechLab, 
        co-chaired application and data system architecture groups, participated in the early exploratory 
        development of FedNow and was part of the team that deployed our current national cash infrastructure 
        system. Previously he was the CEO and founder of Quantum4D â€“ a venture funded (In-Q-Tel) software 
        company that developed holographic systems modeling capabilities for the US intelligence community and 
        SWIFT. He got started in technology at Sun Microsystems and has worked as an Ontologist and Information 
        Architect at various start-ups. He is passionate about the intersection of innovation and public 
        service as they relate to the transformations that may help us resolve previously intractable challenges 
        of climate and inclusion.
