## Our mission

**Advance the science and technology of decentralization and decentralized intelligence, to make it universally accessible and empowering a responsible digital economy.**

### Decentralized Systems

Decentralized trust has many advantages. It provides stronger security guarantees, encourages open access and participation, implies transparency, and empowers different entities and individuals.

Decentralized systems enable decentralized trust. There are different types of decentralized systems: blockchains that enable distributed ledger with decentralized trust, decentralized data science that enables distributed data analytics and machine learning across different data sources.

### Decentralized Intelligence

When we have a programmable decentralized system, we can enable decentralized agents and intelligence. For example, smart contracts are decentralized agents, DAOs envision the future organization structures, and the decentralized AI has huge potentials to surpass many centralized AI systems today.

### Decentralization Empowers New Capabilities & Economy

- Blockchain & Decentralized Finance
- Decentralized Data Science
- Creators Economy
- Ownership Economy
- Data Sovereignty

### Open Research Challenges

In order to enable these new capabilities & economy, we need to address many open research challenges:

- **Scalability**: How to build scalable decentralized systems that can support planet scale usage?
- **Usability**: How to build decentralized systems that are easy to use and universally accessible? How to build self-custody systems that are secure and easy to use?
- **Provable guarantee**: How to build decentralized systems that have provable guarantees of the security and other desired properties? E.g., using formal verification techniques
- **Auditable privacy**: How to enable privacy while still ensure certain transparency, auditability, and compliance in decentralized systems?
- **Incentive compatible**: How to design incentives and economics models to ensure that rational behaviors lead to desired behaviors for the decentralized systems?
- **Systemic stability**: How to design monitoring and defense mechanisms to mitigate systemic risks?
- **Decentralized data science**: How to enable distributed data analytics and machine learning in a privacy-preserving way and make it easy to use for societal benefit?
- **Decentralized intelligence**: How to enable decentralized smart agents to interact and achieve good global utility when making local decisions?
- **Decentralized system building**: How to enable incentive-compatible way for building systems in a decentralized fashion? For reducing mono-culture and concentration of power on code.
- **Decentralized governance and organization**: How to empower effective distributed decision making? how to develop new mechanisms for effective decentralized organization? What types of regulatory framework can best support this?
- **Responsibility**: What are the guidance on regulation; regulation body, and ecosystem?

### Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence

Being responsible, we protect the welfare of individuals and society, protect privacy and be regulation compliant. We level the playing field, empower innovation, promote fairness, inclusiveness, and ethics.

Being decentralized, we innovate in technologies to enable scalable and easy-to-use systems with a decentralized trust and support collaboration among distributed parties. We explore legal frameworks to support decentralized organization structures, as well as analyzing and understanding the societal impact of decentralized systems.

Targetting to improve intelligence, we innovate in technologies to build autonomous agents and organizations operating with decentralized trust, empowering decentralized data science and AI. We also explore new incentive mechanisms for decentralized autonomous agents.
